            The <a href="https://tommadness.github.io/KH2Randomizer//">Kingdom Hearts 2 Randomizer website</a> has setup guides for both
            the PC port and emulator versions of Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix. Very soon, our Resources tab will have lots of setup information along
            with tips and tricks of the trade to help you hit the ground running!

            <p>In the meantime, these resources are a good place to get started:

        <button class="accordion">How do I interpret the tracker?</button>
        <div class="panel">
         <br>
         <br>
          <p>
            The tracker is a tool that racers use to keep track of what important checks they found and where they found them. 
            The icons you see at the bottom of the tracker are called "important checks" and consist of drive forms, ansem reports (hints), 
            magic spells, summons, proofs, second chance, once more, and torn pages. The top half represents each world and how many checks remain in that world.
            For example, consider the tracker image below:

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <center>
               <img src="../static/images/tracker.jpg" width=300px></img>
            </center>

            
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            In this tracker, we can see that Halloween Town, Simulated Twilight Town (tutorial world), and Drive Levels all have 3 checks. Once you
            find the 3 checks in those worlds, there is nothing left to find.

        <button class="accordion">What are the settings for the tournament?</button>
        <div class="panel">
         <br>
         <br>
          <p>There are a lot of intricate settings that go into a randomizer seed so I will cover the basics here and the rest of the details can be found on 
            <a href="https://pastebin.com/tvUuhvt3" style="color: rgb(53, 172, 252)">the tournament pastebin</a>.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Who is allowed to participate in the tournament?</button>
        <div class="panel">
         <br>
         <br>
          <p>

            As the name might suggest, you must be a "Fresh Face" to participate in the tournament. This means that one of the following must apply to you:

          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What happens if I can't stream the race on the exact day of the schedule?</button>
        <div class="panel">
         <br>
         <br>
          <p>
            We've got you covered. If you know you won't be able to play on the date of the qualifier (or race if you advance to the top 32), you can do what's called
            an "async." An async is simply you doing the randomizer seed on your own time while a tournament organizer monitors you. Your time will be included 
            in the pool alongside everyone else's times (or your opponent) on the scheduled day and time. To schedule an async, simply contact one of the Tournament Organizers
            listed in our Contacts page and let them know you are interested in an async!

        <button class="accordion">Why should I join this tournament?</button>
        <div class="panel">
         <br>
         <br>
          <p>The settings have been heavily discussed and engineered to be as inclusive as possible. I personally plan to donate 
            $10 for every new racer up to 40 racers ($400). I will also be asking for pledges to make this number go up so just by joining you are helping
            to raise money for Ukrainian citizens!

        <button class="accordion">The KH2FM Randomizer League will overlap with this tournament. Can I compete in both?</button>
        <div class="panel">
         <br>
         <br>
          <p>
            <b>Absolutely!</b> The Randomizer League is open to everyone, including some of the best in the game. I simply wanted to create a tournament
            where the stakes are significantly lower and you can be rest assured that everyone who enters has a chance at making a deep run regardless of practice.
            That being said, if you are a KH2FM Randomizer enthusiast, I definitely recommend checking out the league.

        <button class="accordion">Why is The World That Never Was turned off?</button>
        <div class="panel">
         <br>
         <br>
          <p>
            The skill range of beginners is quite large and I want to ensure that everyone joining has a chance of winning. This is best accomplished by not allowing for the toughest part of the game to learn being included in the tournament settings. It does make things truly more RANDO-esque, but I think for a charity tournament it's about expanding the community and rewarding everyone who joins with at least some chance to make a deep run in the tournament. That being said, starting at the top 16, I will allow for racers to make a mutual agreement to include climbing the tower AND/OR having checks be found in TWTNW.

        <button class="accordion">This seems like a lot of work. Does roromaniac8 need any help?</button>
        <div class="panel">
         <br>
         <br>
          <p>
            I will take any and all help I can get. If you're interested in being a TO, commentator, incentive racer, editor, or website contributor, please
            let me know on discord (roromaniac8#2464). Additionally, I will personally be donating $10 for every new racer that enters the tournament up to 40 racers ($400).
            I would love to get this number even higher so if you're willing to pledge so that we can continue the $10 donation train for more racers, it would be 
            immensely appreciated and recognized. Even mentioning the tournament on your twitch channels when you stream the randomizer and recommend your 
            more novice player viewers to consider joining is an <i>incredible</i> help.

            P.S. If you're a #help aficionado, if you're able to have open sessions sometime before the first event to help anyone who wants to participate set up,
            it would be greatly appreciated and reflected on the race calendar.
