@Tournament Pings : Now that the obvious cutest couple of DawnJawn and BDBonk has been made official, I'd like to present some updates to the Fresh Faces Tournament
in descending order of importance:

1) Because it will get lost in the shuffle, please fill out Komi's form if you're considering playing in Charity Tourney 5. 

2) We have officially crossed our 40 racer mark in our RSVP list (currently at 51 holy cow)! This is an insane milestone and I'm super grateful for all the participants. That being said, 
part of the incentive I have been using to inspire more people to join is by donating $10 for every new racer up to $400 (40 racers)). If you're someone who can 
and is willing to pledge to raise this number please let me know.

3) After some deliberation, we have decided to have 2 qualifiers. The first one on April 1st proceeds as usual where everyone shows up and does the same seed. We will use the results
of this qualifier to do the following: 

	 

4) Every Sunday starting March 5, myself and couple other TOs will host community practice races and setup sessions to help new racers get acclimated with
the loadless timer, racetime.gg, and knowing what to do come tournament time. If you feel comfortable helping someone through the setup process, let me know 
because we'll use all the help we can get.

5) We have updated our resources page! If you're setup with the randomizer but need some tips on getting better, head on over there.

6) If you care about making a deep run in the tournament, the newer you are, the more I encourage you to practice. There have been some Fresh Faces that hit 
the ground running and will inevitably widen the skill gap. However, if you're just joining to have fun and support the cause, the settings still allow you 
to have a chance at winning, so don't worry too much. The practice is just a suggestion, not a requirement.
